## Welcome to the support page for myCao

myCao helps streamline the CAO application process for Leaving Certificate students by providing a Leaving Certificate points calculator, recommending course's based on the user's favorite school subjects and the ability to browse and view every single CAO course available. Also feature's the ability to save your favorite course's for later viewing and the ability to view every course's website.
